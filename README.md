## Description

1. Create a web server with a `/start` endpoint (you can use any library you want).
   1. It only responds to a POST request.
   2. When it receives the parameter `rtsp_url`, start a new process.
2. The new process reads the video stream from `rtsp_url` using `opencv`.
3. Add a `/stop` endpoint.
   1. Save an image with size 900x900 of the top 9 brightest frames from the video in a grid.
   2. Stop the video reading process.
   3. Display the image in the HTML response.
4. Save this image and send it on the Upwork chat.

## Submission

- Create a zip file exercise.zip
- After it's unzipped, it should contain the project source code.
- The program MUST run inside Docker. We will run your script using the following command:

```shell
unzip exercise.zip
cd exercise
docker build -t exercise .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /path/to/exercise:/app exercise
curl -d "rtsp_url=rtsp://platerec:8S5AZ7YasGc3m4@video.platerecognizer.com:8554/demo" http://localhost:8000/start
curl http://localhost:8000/stop
```
